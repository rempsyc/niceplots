# Important: Functions migrated to rempsyc package
This bundle of "nice" functions is now deprecated. All functions have migrated to the rempsyc package. They have been improved and the syntax was changed from a dot capital to underscore (e.g., old = "niceViolin", new = "nice_violin"). Please install and use the new package here: https://github.com/rempsyc/rempsyc/.

# niceplots [deprecated]
Convenience functions to make easily customizable plots (via ggplot2), nice APA tables exportable to Word, test statistical assumptions, and complete various other tasks.
